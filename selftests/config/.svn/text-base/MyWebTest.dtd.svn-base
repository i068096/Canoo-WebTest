<!--
    For effective use when writing webtests, we need a DTD that covers
    Ant tasks, WebTests tasks and project specific entities.
    This DTD is a holder for these.
    WebTest.dtd is generated at build time with antstructure,
    and Project.dtd with a groovy script.

    Future versions may use antstructure calls to generate only
    the ant specific entries,  while the webtest.dtd may be constructed
    with xdoclet.
-->

<!-- all elements known to ant when /build/selftests/build.xml is called -->
<!ENTITY % webtest  SYSTEM "../config/WebTest.dtd" >
<!-- project specific entities -->
<!ENTITY % project  SYSTEM "../config/Project.dtd">

%webtest;
%project;
