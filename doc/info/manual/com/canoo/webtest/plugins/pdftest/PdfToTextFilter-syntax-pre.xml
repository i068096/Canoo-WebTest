        In general, PDF documents can place text in documents using a variety of mechanisms. They may contain
        text as a stream of characters in an expected order, the order may not be expected but explicit
        positioning will place it in the correct position or it may contain graphical representations
        of the characters. For these reasons, this filter may not always produce what you expect.
        You will have to experiment to see what will work for you.
