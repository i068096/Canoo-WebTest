        Note that <em>subject</em> and the email address attributes
        (<em>to</em>, <em>from</em>, <em>cc</em> and <em>replyTo</em>)
        are used for matching purposes to select a subset of the available messages.
        Each can be either plain text or a <key>regex</key>.
        Simply start and end them with the "/" character to make them a <key>regex</key>.
        If all of these are left blank, all messages will be selected for counting.
        In addition, <em>to</em>, <em>cc</em> and <em>replyTo</em> may contain
        a comma (",") separated list of email addresses. Each address must appear
        in an email message for it to match - order is not important.
