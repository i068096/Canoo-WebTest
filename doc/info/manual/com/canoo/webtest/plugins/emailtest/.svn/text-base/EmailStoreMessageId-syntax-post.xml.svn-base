        Here is an example of using the <em>emailStoreMessageId</em> step.
    </b>

    <code caption="emailStoreMessageId">
        <include src='emailexamples/emailStoreMessageIdExample.xml'/>
    </code>

    <b>
        Note that <em>subject</em> and the email address attributes
        (<em>to</em>, <em>from</em>, <em>cc</em> and <em>replyTo</em>)
        are used for matching purposes to select a subset of the available messages.
        Each can be either plain text (like <em>subject</em> and <em>from</em>
        in the above example) or a <key>regex</key> (like <em>to</em>, <em>cc</em>
        and <em>replyTo</em> in the above example).
        Simply start and end them with the "/" character to make them a <key>regex</key>.
        If all of these are left blank, all messages will be selected (and you can use
        <em>messageIndex</em> to select a particular message if you know its position).
        In addition, <em>to</em>, <em>cc</em> and <em>replyTo</em> may contain
        a comma (",") separated list of email addresses. Each address must appear
        in an email message for it to match - order is not important.
