        The <em>delay</em> attribute is a convenience mechanism
        that has the same effect as putting a <stepref name="sleep" category="core"/>
        in front of all of your <em>email</em> steps. This is
        provided because many email servers have issues with
        opening connections immediately after the previous one has
        been closed. If you steps are failing in an unexpected fashion,
        turn on debugging - if it shows that sometimes fewer messages
        are on your email server than you expect, try increasing
        the delay value. If that doesn't work, you can try placing your
        step(s) within a <stepref name="retry" category="extension"/> loop.
