    Suppose that you make a test to ensure that an issue registered in
    your issue tracking system is now fixed. You can write this information in the <em>webtest</em> using
    <em>testInfo</em> for instance this way
    </b>

    <code caption='testInfo Example'>
        <include src='examples/testInfoExample1.xml'/>
    </code>

	<b>
	Using the standard HTML reports generated by WebTest this information is displayed on the top
	of the test details.
	As <em>issueNumber</em> is a special type for testInfo, an additional formatting occurs here: an hyper link is created
	to the issue number in the bug tracking system (according that you set the build property <em>wt.htmlReports.testInfo.issueNumber.baseUrl</em>
	to specify the base url of your bug tracking system).
	</b>
	
	<section title="Special types">
	<b><em>testInfo</em> can be used for any type of information but two types are handled specially by WebTest's standard report generation:</b>
	<attributes>
		<attribute>
			<name>issueNumber</name>
			<description>It tells WebTest to generate an hyper link from the <em>info</em> attribute allowing to have a clickable link
			to an issue related to the test directly from the test report.
			The value of the build property <em>wt.htmlReports.testInfo.issueNumber.baseUrl</em> is prepended to the <em>info</em> value.
			In the case of WebTest's issue tracker, this property is set to <em>http://webtest-community.canoo.com/jira/browse/</em>
			to create links like <em>http://webtest-community.canoo.com/jira/browse/WT-250</em>.
