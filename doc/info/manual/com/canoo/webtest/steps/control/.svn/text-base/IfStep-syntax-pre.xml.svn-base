<b>
Provides the ability for conditional testing. The step takes either one of the two attributes
<em>test</em> and <em>unless</em>, or a single nested element <em>condition</em>.
Exactly one of these must have a value.</b>
<b>If the <em>test</em> attribute is set and evaluates to <em>true</em>, the
encapsulated steps will be executed. If the <em>unless</em> attribute is set
and evaluates to <em>false</em>, the intermediate steps will be executed.
</b>
<b>If there is a nested element <em>condition</em>, the intermediate steps will be executed
if all steps nested inside the <em>condition</em> are successful.</b>
<b>
<em>NOTE</em>: using this step too frequently can lead to overly
complicated and difficult to understand test scripts.
