    <b>The actual repetition counter is made available to the steps included in the
    <em>&lt;retry&gt;</em> step by a special property. Its default name
    is &quot;count&quot; unless modified by the <em>counterName</em> attribute.
    This property can be referenced within(!) steps included in the <em>&lt;retry&gt;
    </em> step using this notation &quot;#{count}&quot; or the specified countername.</b>
