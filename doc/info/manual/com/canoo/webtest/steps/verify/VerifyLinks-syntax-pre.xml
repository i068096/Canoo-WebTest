    <b>You can use this test recursively, so you can also check the links on the pages,
    which are linked on the current page and so on. For this reason, you can specify the <em>depth</em> parameter.</b>

    <b>To avoid scanning sub-links on other hosts, you can set the <em>onsiteonly</em> parameter.
    If it is set to &quot;true&quot;, only the first link on a foreign host is checked for validity.</b>
