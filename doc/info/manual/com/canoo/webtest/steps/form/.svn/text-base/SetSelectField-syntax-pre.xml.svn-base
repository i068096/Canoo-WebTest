    <b>The select field to set will be determined by finding the appropriate form followed by
    finding the appropriate field on that form unless an xpath or html id is provided for a direct access. 
	Once the appropriate select field is chosen the appropriate option within the field to set is determined.</b>

    <b><em>Form Selection</em>: In many cases, your page will only have
    one form - that form will be used - you don't need to worry about trying to select the form.
    For tricky cases, you might need to do extra work to select the appropriate form.
    See the <stepref name="setRadioButton"/> step for further details on how to do this.</b>

    <b><em>Field Selection</em>: in many cases, only one field will match the <em>name</em>
    of the field you are interested in. In these cases, you don't need to worry about the remaining details
    for selecting fields. For tricky cases, you might need to do extra work to select the appropriate field.
    See the <stepref name="setInputField"/> step for further details on how to do this.
	If <em>xpath</em> or <em>htmlId</em> identifies a select, then one of <em>value</em>, <em>text</em>, 
	or <em>optionIndex</em> is required to identify the option within the select.
	</b>

    <b><em>Option Selection</em>: the option to set is selected as follows:
    </b><dl>
        <li><dd>If the <em>xpath</em> value identifies an option, set that option.</dd></li>
        <li><dd>If the <em>htmlId</em> value identifies an option, set that option.</dd></li>
        <li><dd>If an option in the chosen select field matches by <em>value</em>, set that option.</dd></li>
        <li><dd>If an option in the chosen select field matches by its <em>text</em>, set that option.</dd></li>
        <li><dd>If an option in the chosen select field matches by its <em>optionIndex</em>, set that option.</dd></li>
    </dl>

    <b><em>NOTE</em>: A <key>regex</key> can be specified if a particular option is selected by its text.</b>
