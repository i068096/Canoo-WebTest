        Using the <em>eval</em> attribute indicates that the property should
        be treated as numeric and any simple expressions within the value should
        be evaluated. Brackets '(' and ')' as well as mathematical operators
        '+', '-', '*', '/' and '%' are supported. The result is treated as a
        double but converted back to a string before being stored into the
        property.
