    <b>Option settings provide a crude mechanism to alter settings provided by the underlying
        browser client layer. This sometimes allows settings needed for a particular test to be changed
        without coding. They may stop working if supporting jar file versions change or if
        WebTest provides more complete support via a different approach in the future. See the JavaDoc
        for

        for more details - look in the source as the relevant JavaDocs are
        for private methods and do not show in the published JavaDocs.
