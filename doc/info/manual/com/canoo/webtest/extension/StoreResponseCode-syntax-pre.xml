	<b>Normally, you can safely ignore <key>HTTP</key> response codes while using <key>CWT</key>.
    Simply try to use web resources normally in your tests. Any which can't be retrieved normally
    (i.e. which don't return <key>HTTP</key> status code of '200') will cause your steps to fail.</b>

    <b>Sometimes however, it is useful to retrieve the response code, e.g. to distinguish
    between server errors (typically code '500'), missing resources (code '404') and security
    issues (typically codes 401 or 403). Or perhaps to verify the messages which these kind of errors
     display to the user. This step allows you to achieve this requirement. In order for <key>CWT</key>
    to not report non-'200' status codes as an error, you need to set an option (see below).</b>
