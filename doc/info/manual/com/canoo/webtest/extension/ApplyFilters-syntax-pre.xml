    <b>This step allows you to apply one or more filter(s) to the current response
    and then perform some simple tests on the result as if the filtered result
    is a new response.</b>
    
    <b>This step should be treated as experimental. It does a few hacks under the covers
    but has been very useful for debugging purposes. If you use this step, a recommended
    approach is to not perform subsequent invokes after this step, i.e. this step should
    be near the end of your test sequence.</b>
