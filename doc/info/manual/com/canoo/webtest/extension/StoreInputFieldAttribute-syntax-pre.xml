        This step provides a mechanism to peek inside the state of
        input elements inside your
        <key>HTML</key>. It should be used with care as
        the user (via their browser) typically wouldn't have direct access to these
        states (but probably are given an alternative visual
        representation, e.g. if the state is disabled, the element
        will probably be greyed out). Because WebTest doesn't
        represent the page graphically, peeking at the states
        can be the next best thing to know what is going on.

        Available states include: "checked" and "disabled".
