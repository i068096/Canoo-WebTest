    <b>The following example illustrates how to use the <em>storeLength</em> step (illustrating
        the use of the nested table locator step):</b>

    <b>One of the ways to calculate the length value (so that you can write the test) is to use a
        dummy value (e.g. '999') and then run the test. Then when it fails it will tell you what it was expecting.
        Simply copy that value into your test. Eventually we may store length values in a file and populate the
        file for you the first time the test is run or we may have a tool (e.g. Mozilla plug-in or one of the
        other recorder tools) to pre-calculate length values for you.</b>
