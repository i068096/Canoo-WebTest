        Maintaining test data can be one of the biggest challenges
        with keeping a test suite relevant and not too brittle as
        environments, requirements and external factors change. Random
        data provides another valuable tool to assist in maintaining test
        data in complex systems.

        Care must be exercised when using random data. If selecting test
        data by hand, careful choices can be made to ensure that boundary
        cases are covered by tests. Using purely random data may make this
        harder to do. Having said that, random data
        can simplify build scripts, can reduce the risk that poor
        test cases are chosen and lends itself to being suitable for
        load or stress testing with different data in multiple test runs.
