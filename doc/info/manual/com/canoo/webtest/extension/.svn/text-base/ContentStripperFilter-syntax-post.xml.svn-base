    <b>This content filter can be useful in environments where the tags stay the same but content may
        change, e.g. a home page with a fixed number of news items - the content of news items change
        but the tags and other document structure stay the same. This tag removes content hence removes the
    part of the response subject to change. The remaining characters can then be safely compared to an expected value.</b>

    <b>See the <stepref name="verifyContent"/> step for an example of using this content filter.</b>
