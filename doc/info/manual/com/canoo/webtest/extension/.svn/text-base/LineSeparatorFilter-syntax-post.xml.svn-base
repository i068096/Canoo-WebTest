    <b>This content filter can be useful in environments with mixed Unix/Windows/Mac machines or if there are differences
        in your development and build environments related to version control systems. E.g., some of your development
        environments or your continuous integration/build environment may have gzip compression for CVS access
        turned on (which will bypass line separator expansion on Windows machines). In general, it is recommended
        that you always use this filter for steps which take content filters. It isn't very expensive and will
        make your builds and tests resistant to future changes in operating systems and/or other settings.</b>

    <b>See the <stepref name="verifyContent"/>,
        <stepref name="storeLength"/> and
        <stepref name="storeDigest"/> steps for some examples of using this content filter.</b>
