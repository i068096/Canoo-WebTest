    <b>Consider the following <key>HTML</key> form:</b>

    <code caption='inputFieldAttributePage.html'>
    <include src='examples/forceInputFieldAttributePageHtml.xml' />
    </code>

    <b>This page contains some <key>javascript</key> validation. We would like to use the <stepref name="storeInputFieldAttribute"/>
    step to check that the validation is working. When the form is first loaded, the "Click Me" button should
    be disabled as the "value1" field is empty. We can then place some content into the field. However
    because the onkeyup <key>javascript</key> event is not supported, we note that the "Click Me" button is still
    disabled. We can use the <em>&lt;forceInputFieldAttribute&gt;</em> to force the button to become enabled.
    For the enabled attribute, we need to remove the "disabled" attribute to enable the button. We do this
    by setting the "attributeValue" to the empty string "".
    Here is the script code:</b>

    <code caption='forceInputFieldAttribute Example'>
        <include src='examples/forceInputFieldAttributeExample.xml'/>
    </code>
