        This step provides a mechanism to alter the value of a hidden input field.
        Hidden input fields are often used within forms to help with state management
        of a web application. They are often set using <key>javascript</key> and because
        not all features of <key>javascript</key> are supported by <key>CWT</key>,
        it can sometimes be useful to mimic what the <key>javascript</key> would
        do with a manual step.

        If you have a very sophisticated web application that makes use of a lot of
        hidden input fields for your state management, this step can assist you in
        partitioning your tests into their functional and "unit" aspects. Firstly,
        you write "unit" tests where you manipulate your application in various
        ways and check that the hidden fields are set appropriately. These don't
        require invoking the server application so they run fast. Then you run
        some functional tests which check that for a given set of values of
        the hidden fields, your application performs as expected.
