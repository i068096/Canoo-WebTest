    <b>This content filter can be useful in environments where the content stays the same but tags or tag
        attributes may change, e.g. a simple portal with presentation preferences depicted in CSS or other
        presentation-oriented tags. This tag removes the tags (and any attributes) hence removes the
    part of the response subject to change. The remainder can then be safely compared to an expected value.</b>

    <b>See the <stepref name="verifyContent"/> step for an example of using this content filter.</b>
