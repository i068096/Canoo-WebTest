    <b>The <em>&lt;verifyNoDialogs&gt;</em> step is used after clicking on a link or button
    which invokes some <key>javascript</key> that uses dialogs (Alert, Confirm or Prompt dialogs).
    It is used in conjunction with the <stepref name="expectDialogs"/> step which sets up
    dialog expectations prior to clicking the link or button. Invoking this step
    after the click request allows you to check that all expected responses were
    in fact used by the <key>javascript</key>.</b>
