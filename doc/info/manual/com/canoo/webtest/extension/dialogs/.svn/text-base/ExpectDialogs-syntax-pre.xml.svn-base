    <b>This step is used prior to clicking on a link or button
    which invokes some <key>javascript</key> that uses dialogs (Alert, Confirm or Prompt dialogs).
    If you don't use this step, <key>CWT</key> simply clicks 'OK' on every dialog silently.
    This is OK if you don't care about the Dialogs, but if you do care, you have no way of
    telling if anything was actually clicked or what messages were displayed in the dialogs.</b>

    <b>You may be wondering why you need to set up expectations prior to clicking on a link
    or button. This is mostly due to implementation issues with the way <key>CWT</key> works
    and the way it calls <key>htmlunit</key>. It turns out to be easier at the moment to
    create a list of dialog expectations. As interactions with your application cause
    <key>javascript</key> to invoke dialogs, we simply look at the next dialog expectation
    on the list, check that it meets expectations (or optionally save away the dialog
    message text) and then remove it from the list.
    For tricky <key>javascript</key> there may be multiple interactions from the user.
    We simply list all the expected dialog interactions in the order we expect them to occur.

    <b>Often you will use the
        <stepref name="verifyNoDialogs"/>
        step in conjunction
        with this step to ensure that your expectations for dialogs were met. The
        <stepref name="verifyNoDialogs"/>
        step is used after clicking on your link or button - it
        checks that the list of expected dialogs is now empty, i.e. by the
        time you have finished interacting with your application all the dialogs you
        were expecting to need clicking were actually clicked.
