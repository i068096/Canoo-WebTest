    <b>Consider the following <key>HTML</key> form:</b>

    <code caption='hiddenInputFieldPage.html'>
    <include src='examples/forceHiddenInputFieldPageHtml.xml' />
    </code>

    <b>This page contains some <key>javascript</key> functionality which sets a hidden field.
    We would like to use the <em>&lt;forceHiddenInputField&gt;</em> step to check that the hidden
    field is being set correctly. When the form is first loaded, the hidden field should
    be set to 'zzz'. We can then place some content into 'field1'. We can then check that the
    hidden field was successfully changed to 'xxx'. Here is an example test script:</b>

    <code caption='hiddenInputField Example1'>
        <include src='examples/forceHiddenInputFieldExample1.xml'/>
    </code>

    <b>We can try to do the same thing for 'field2', however because the <em>onkeyup</em> <key>javascript</key>
    event is not supported, the hidden field remains unchanged. We can then use the
    <em>&lt;forceHiddenInputField&gt;</em> to force the hidden field change to 'yyy'.
    Here is the script code:</b>

    <code caption='hiddenInputField Example2'>
        <include src='examples/forceHiddenInputFieldExample2.xml'/>
    </code>

    <b><em>See also</em>: the <stepref name="storeXPath" category="Core"/> and <stepref name="verifyXPath" category="Core"/> steps which can be used to read/verify hidden fields.</b>
