    <b><em>NOTE</em>: the <em>ThrowExceptionOnFailingStatusCode</em> option setting
    in the <stepref name="config"/> element needs to be set to <em>false</em>. You don't
    need to set this option if you want to test for return status codes of '200' but if
    the step doesn't fail, you already know it is a '200' status code.</b>
