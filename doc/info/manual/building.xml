	<head title="Building WebTest">
		<b>This page describes how to build webtest from the sources.
			The build file included with the source provides a complete and repeatable build process, which the second
			section explains.
			The build file is used by the build server to produces high quality deliveries but can, and should, also be
			used to
			develop WebTest. It is however convenient during development to build webtest from the comfort of an IDE,
			and the third section gives a few hints on ow to set-up an IDE.

		<b>Rebuilding the whole Canoo WebTest from the source may be
			an option if you want to change it's behavior.
		</b>

		<b>First, checkout the latest version from the svn repository to
			<example>&lt;WEBTEST_HOME&gt;</example>
			:
		</b>
		<code>svn co https://svn.canoo.com/trunk/webtest</code>
		<b>Then call the build script. Depending from your operating system, it may be necessary to fiddle
			with the execution rights of the scripts in the directory
			<example>bin/</example>
			.
		</b>
		<b>The main build file in
			<example>&lt;WEBTEST_HOME&gt;</example>
			provides the following targets:
		</b>
		<dl>
			<li>
				<dt>clean</dt>
				<dd>Deletes (most of) the results of a previous build.</dd>
			</li>
			<li>
				<dt>develop</dt>
				<dd>Compiles and tests webtest.</dd>
			</li>
			<li>
				<dt>full</dt>
				<dd>Compiles and tests webtest, then generates all kinds of documentations and reports.
					<n/>
					This is the target used by the build server.
				</dd>
			</li>
			<li>
				<dt>fetchDependencies</dt>
				<dd>Lets maven fetch all the dependencies described in the pom.
					This target needs only to be called explicitly if the build will occur offline.
				</dd>
			</li>
		</dl>
		<b>To generate a complete release, including the documentation, type:</b>
		<code>
			cd &lt;WEBTEST_HOME&gt;
			<n/>
			bin/webtest.sh full
		</code>
		<b>To get a clean build without documentation, type:</b>
		<code>
			cd &lt;WEBTEST_HOME&gt;
			<n/>
			bin/webtest clean develop
		</code>

	<section title="Building with an IDE">
		<b>As there are too many possible IDEs, this section only outlines how to set-up an IDE.</b>
		<b>Although webtest build is an ant script, it is taking advantage of
			<key>Maven</key>
			's (version 2) declarative
			definition of dependencies: All dependencies required to build and run webtest are defined in the file
			<em>pom.xml</em>
			. The target
			<em>fetchDependencies</em>
			of the build script looks at the required dependencies, looks at maven's dependency cache (in the user's
			home directory) and downloads the dependency jar files from one of the
			maven repositories to the shared dependency cache.
		</b>
		<b>Since the actual dependency jar files are not part of the module, but potentially shared with other unrelated
			projects, the difficulty is to tell the IDE which jar files it needs and where they are. The easiest
			solution is to take advantage of maven's various plugins to convert webtest's
			<em>pom.xml</em>
			to a project file for an IDE. This requires of course maven (version 2!) to be available on the machine.
		</b>
		<b>Note that some dependencies are indeed part of webtest's module: these are jar files for versions that are
			not (yet?) available on a public maven repository. These jar files are however organized as a local maven
			repository and accessed like every other dependencies.

		<b>Note that working with the generated project-files in eclipse requires to define a new classpath
