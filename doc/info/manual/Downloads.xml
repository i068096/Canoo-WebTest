        <b>The 3.0 Release consolidates all changes to Canoo WebTest since release 2.6 (see
        <ext href="http://webtest-community.canoo.com/jira/browse/WT?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:changelog-panel">Change log</ext>)
        </b>
        <b>This is the recommended version of WebTest for beginners. Existing users are also encouraged to upgrade.
        It offers many improvements over release 2.6 (bug fixes, speed improvements, better javascript support, ...)
        </b>
        <b>Contrary to earlier releases, release 3.0 requires Java 5.</b>
        <b><em>Warning:</em> possible changes in XPath usage<n/>
        Starting with build 1700, the HtmlUnit version used by WebTest has been upgraded to the latest 2.x release,
        which doesn't use Jaxen anymore for XPath evaluation with a custom document navigator but standard DOM tools.
        The consequence is that XPath expressions
        now have to be "fully correct" and can't use shortcuts that were previously available.
        For example an expression like "//tr[td='2.1']/td[3]" won't work
        anymore and should be replaced with something like "//tr[td/text() = '2.1']/td[3]".
        Additionally, spaces are no longer trimmed to respect XPath standards
        (the function wt:cleanText can be used to ignore whitespaces).
