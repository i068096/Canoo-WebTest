        <b>WebTest knows about two kinds of properties, <em>ant</em> properties and
            <em>dynamic</em> properties. You typically select which kind you want to
            store into using the <em>propertyType</em> attribute
            of the storeXXX steps or by setting a <em>defaultpropertytype</em>
            in your <stepref name="config" category="general"/>.
            You select which kind you want to read from using the
            <em>${}</em> or <em>#{}</em> syntax.
            This section explains additional details about these
            two kinds of properties.

    <section title="Ant Properties">
        <b>${} properties are normal
            <key>ANT</key> properties. Given
            <key>ANT</key>'s philosophy
            of a declarative build process, these are normally immutable.
            I.e. once you set a property its value normally can't be changed.
            <key>ANT</key> property values are typically determined at the start of an
            ant target. They are available to both
            <key>ANT</key> tasks and WebTest steps.</b>

    <section title="Dynamic Properties">
        <b>
            #{} properties are only available (currently) to webtest steps.
            They are dynamic - you can use the same property and set it to
            different things throughout your tests. #{} properties support
            very simple expressions and there is support for accessing
            scripting variables under special circumstances. Property values
            are determined at the moment of use.

    <section title="Nested Properties Expansion">
        <b>
            Contrary to normal Ant execution 
            (see <ext href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29347">Ant's enhancement issue</ext>), 
            nested properties are evaluated during the execution of a WebTest.
            This means for instance that something like <em>${myProp#{counter}}</em> will be evaluated 
            just like <em>${myProp1}</em> if the current value of the dynamic property <em>counter</em> is <em>1</em>.
            Both nested Ant properties and dynamic properties are evaluated.

        <b>You can happily swap between them using
            <stepref name="storeProperty" category='Core'/>
            by setting the <em>propertyType</em>
            attribute to the appropriate value.
