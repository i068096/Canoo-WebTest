        <b>First, identify, close and assign to the release project all issues that belong to the project.
            Since this will be used for the release note, consider only the issues that have been fixed,
            and do not the rejected issues (invalid, ...).</b>
        <b>Then, mark the project as
            <em>released</em>

        </b>
        <b>Let jira generate the release note for the project, and saves it locally.
            It may be necessary to correct the formatting, in particular when the subject line contains webtest step
            names.</b>
