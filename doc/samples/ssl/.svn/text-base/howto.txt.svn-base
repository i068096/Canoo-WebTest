        How to get the SSL sample to run
        ================================

1) Install Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) as described in the included API User's Guide
   JSSE is included in jdk1.4. For earlier versions it is available from
        http://java.sun.com/products/jsse

        Installation steps for JSSE 1.0.2 (required for JDK1.3.X) include:
        - copy jerct.jar, jnet.jar and jsse.jar to <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/ext
	  (jars are included in the lib directory of the WebTest distribution)
        - install security provider in <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/security/java.security
          E.g.: security.provider.3=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider

2) Import the site certificate in the cacerts keystore in order to "trust" the site you want to test against. E.g.:
   > keytool -keystore %JAVA_HOME%\jre\lib\security\cacerts -import -file canoo.cer -alias canoo
        (The initial password for the keystore in JSSE 1.0.2 is "changeit")

3) Adapt the sslTest.xml in order to use the correct site, username and password. Canooes should just add the
   required username and password upon invocation:
   > ant -verbose -buildfile sslTest.xml -Dusername=[theRealUsername] -Dpassword=[theRealPassword]

Everything else is just pure magic ...
